Since "inline" is (more or less) a hint for the compiler to inline functions, 
the functions may be inlined or not.
The compiler may choose to inline nearly all functions except for, according to
[this link](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-high-performance/9781787120952/e1993858-74f1-446d-8c9e-5fb9b231bfe7.xhtml),
the wrapper function std::function, which cannot be inlined because of it's
flexibility.
Proving through assembly code proved rather unfruitful, be it through mu undoing
or the compilers.
Following ways were tried:
```
g++ -Winline -o name -O[0-3] -S name.cpp
```
and also by adding functions to be inlied to the header file.
